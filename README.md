**LEAF: Language Learners' English Essays and Feedback Corpus** <br>
> [Shabnam Behzad](https://shabnam-b.github.io/), Omid Kashefi, Swapna Somasundaran. <br>




The second verion of the LEAF dataset is avaible as data.jsonl <br>
Changes we made: <br>
- Only comments from "Educational Consultants" are kept to ensure higher quality feedback, so this version is a little smaller than reported in the paper. <br>
- Splits are now 500/400/4042 test/dev/train <br>
